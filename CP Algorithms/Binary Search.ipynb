    "The most typical problem that leads to the binary search is as follows. You're given a sorted array A0 <= A1 <= A2 <= ... <= An-1, check if k is present within the sequence. The simplest solution would be to check every element one by one and compare it with k (a so-called linear search). This approach works in O(N) , but doesn't utilize the fact that the array is sorted.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now assume that we know two indices L < R such that A_L <= k <= A_R. Because the array is sorted, we can deduce that k either occurs among A_L, A_{L+1}, ..., A_R or doesn't occur in the array at all. If we pick an arbitrary index M such that L < M < R and check whether k is less or greater than A_M, we have two possible cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A_L <= k <= A_M. In this case, we reduce the problem from [L, R] to [L, M].\n",
    "2. A_M <= k <= A_R. In this case, we reduce the problem from [L, R] to [M, R].\n",
    "\n",
    "When it is impossible to pick M, that is, when R = L + 1, we directly compare k with A_L and A_R. Otherwise, we would want to pick M in such a manner that it reduces the active segment to a single element as quickly as possible in the worst case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since in the worst case we will always reduce to the larger segment of [L, M] and [M, R], the reduction would be from R-L to max(M-L, R-M). To minimize this value, we should pick M approximately as: M ≈ (L+R)/2, then M-L ≈ (R-L)/2 ≈ R-M."
